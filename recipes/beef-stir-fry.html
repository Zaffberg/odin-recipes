<h2 class="back">Beef Stir Fry that ready to eat</h2>
    <p>After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of 
        the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of 
        the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add 
        the soy sauce and sesame seeds. </p>
    <p>Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as 
        broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for 
        only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate 
        your beef in one if you prefer. </p>
